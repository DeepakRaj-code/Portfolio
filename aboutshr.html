        I’m Shristi!!
        <br><br>
         A dedicated and versatile individual passionate about problem-solving and technology. With a
        strong foundation in web development, I enjoy creating functional and visually appealing digital solutions.

        I’ve been fortunate to achieve milestones like , NEET-UG with a score of 613,qualifying for the Idea Pitching Competition (1st Round)
        and Pre-RMO, which reflect my analytical thinking and determination. These experiences have sharpened my ability
        to tackle challenges creatively and effectively.

        Beyond academics, I’m constantly honing my technical skills in web development, exploring innovative approaches
        to design and development. I’m driven by a desire to grow and make an impact through meaningful work.
